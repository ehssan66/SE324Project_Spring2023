# Project Phase One

This work is done as part of Project Phase One for SE324-Spring2023.

## To Run The Project

You must run the server then the client to see the full work. In order to run each, refer to the README file in both the server and the client directories.
Note that you might need to open the server and the client in sperate windows of your IDE and run each one on its own, however, it worked with me in the same IDE window.

## Idea of The Project

The idea is to create a server which stores puzzles and their solutions, and a client which consumes the API provided by the server to request a puzzle and display it in the GUI.

## Further Info

The server is built with Java Spring, and the client uses Java Swing to create the GUI. Finally, the tests were written using JUnit.

In this directory, you can see a design folder, which contains an overall architecture of the project, and a class diagram.

You can also see a test_report folder which has the coverage report generated when running the tests with Coverage in IntelliJ IDEA. To view the report, open test_report/index.html in any browser.
